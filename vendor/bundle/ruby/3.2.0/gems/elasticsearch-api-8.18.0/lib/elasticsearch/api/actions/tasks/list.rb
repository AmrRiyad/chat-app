        # @option arguments [List] :nodes A comma-separated list of node IDs or names to limit the returned information; use `_local` to return information from the node you're connecting to, leave empty to get information from all nodes
        # @option arguments [List] :actions A comma-separated list of actions that should be returned. Leave empty to return all.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :detailed Return detailed task information (default: false)
        # @option arguments [String] :parent_task_id Return tasks with specified parent task id (node_id:task_number). Set to -1 to return all.
        # @option arguments [Boolean] :wait_for_completion Wait for the matching tasks to complete (default: false)
        # @option arguments [String] :group_by Group tasks by nodes or parent/child relationships (options: nodes, parents, none)
